Design and implement a CNN-based autoencoder using PyTorch and train it on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset. Train the model for reconstruction using MSE loss while enforcing a regularization constraint that restricts all weights to the range [âˆ’0.5, 0.5]. Additionally, train another autoencoder using MSE loss with above-mentioned weight clipping and incorporate an L1-based sparsity constraint. Compare both models under identical training conditions by assessing their performance using the PSNR score. Conduct hyperparameter tuning by experimenting with different activation functions and optimizers. Ensure the model is trained for at least 100 epochs or until the loss curve stabilizes.
