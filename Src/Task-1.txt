Implement an MLP using PyTorch for the Classification of the MNIST Dataset. Preprocess the dataset by reshaping each image into a 1D vector, then apply transforms such as rotation, scaling, etc. Build the MLP with dropout and batch normalization layers to improve generalization. Implement a custom weight initialization function for the network. Report accuracy, and loss, and analyze the impact of custom regularization on overfitting. Additionally, it reports precision, recall, and F1-score, and generates a confusion matrix for the test results. Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
