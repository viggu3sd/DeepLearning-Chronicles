Download and preprocess (Augmentation if needed)the Pascal VOC dataset (http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/). 

Implement and evaluate two DETR variants, one using a ResNet-50 backbone along with transformer Encoder-Decoder, and the other using a Vision Transformer (ViT).
Train the model and monitor the training progress by logging metrics like loss.
Evaluate your trained model on the test dataset and compute metrics like mAP, AP50, AP75, precision-recall and f1 scores.
Compare the performance of two architectures.
